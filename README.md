PROJECT TITLE
TIC TAC TOE game in python.

OVERVIEW
A simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game utilizes Python functions, lists, and interactive input, allowing two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

FEATURES
•	Interactive gameplay for two players ('X' and 'O')
•	Dynamic 3x3 board display
•	Input validation to prevent illegal moves
•	Win and draw detection after every move
•	Clear game-end messages
•	Self-contained source code; no external libraries required

TECHNOLOGIES USED
•	Python (built-in data structures and functions)
•	Console Input/Output
•	No third-party dependencies

STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN
1.	Download or copy the Python script into a local file, e.g., tic_tac_toe.py.
2.	Make sure Python (3.x) is installed on your system.
3.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.	Navigate to the directory containing tic_tac_toe.py.
5.	Run the game using:   python tic_tac_toe.py
6.	
INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING
•	When prompted, enter your moves by specifying row and column numbers separated by a space (e.g., 1 2).
•	Only positions labelled with a blank space can be chosen.
•	The game validates each move and will prompt again if the input is invalid.
•	After a win or draw, the game exits automatically.
